## JS is a Beast!

JavaScript has taken over development:

 - DataBase - MongoDB leveraging **JS**ON
 - Server - Node**JS**
 - FrontEnd - React**JS**, Vue**JS**, etc.
 - Mobile - React**JS** Native
 - Desktop - Electron**JS**
 - AI - TensorFlow**JS**
 - etc.

JavaScript went from being considered a toy language to dominating the development space and being the first choice for many programmers.

The [community logo](https://github.com/voodootikigod/logo.js/) for JavaScript is great and very professional.

By contrast, this design is meant to stand-out as fun, playful, and a clear indication of how JavaScript is now a BEAST of a language.

Taking inspiration from the official logo and being a fan of creative mascots, I present the JS Monster:

</p>

This all started with a single image of JS eats the world:

I loved the image so much it quickly expanded into a series that have been printed as stickers, magnets, and more. Please feel free to contribute your own square, furry, yellow, monsters. If you see me at a conference or event, please introduct yourself and ask for a sticker.

Expect more designs in the future.
